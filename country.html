                    This is quite a challening song, and I am still yet to learn it fully, but I have go most of the A section down, with only the rhythm between riffs needing to be improved. Part of the difficulty of this song is that it has a a very complicated melody playing over a bass riff thatr sounds terrible if you dont get the rhythm of the bass right, and sinc ethe bass often plays on offbeats, it gets very difficult very fast
