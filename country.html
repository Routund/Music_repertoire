                    This is quite a challenging song, and I am still yet to learn it fully, 
                    but I have go most of the A section down, with only the rhythm between riffs 
                    needing to be improved. Part of the difficulty of this song is that it has 
                    a very complicated melody playing over a bass riff that sounds terrible if 
                    you dont get the rhythm of the bass right, and since the bass often plays 
                    on off beats, it gets very difficult very fast

                    While the tab on the left is for the banjo, the chords remain same between 
                    the banjo and guitar and thusly, I can play the chords on the guitar. 
                    I couldn't find any free shet music that was on the guitar so I had to put this up instead. 
                    This tab also doesnt include the intro section, but tis quite short and easy, and any video online can shpw you it, 
                    the main challenge is playing the chords, since they have a variety of different hand shapes and go up and down the fret board
