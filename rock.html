                    "Salida del Sol" is a classical guitar composition from the 1900s that I learned in 2021.
                    I feel like this piece is probably my most practiced piece, and can sometimes play it with my eyes close. Set in an andante tempo and structured as A-B-A,
                    this composition showcases a precise blend of melody and harmony. <br><br>
                    As part of my classical repertoire, "Salida del Sol" offers a serene musical journey,
                    evoking imagery of a slow sunrise over peaceful landscapes through its measured and calculated composition.
                    Even though I practice this song alot, I still do have a few problems with playing the ending for the A section, as I only learned the proper structure for playing it very recently. I often forget to play it and play the ending for the first A section, which can be quite confusing.

                    Allegro is probably the first song I learned that utilizes alot of fingerpicking, learning it in 2021. While it sounds impressive, the hand shapes needed to play the main motifs are often quite simple, sometimes being basic chords, and never requiring all 4 fingers to use<br><br>
