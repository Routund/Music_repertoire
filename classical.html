                    "Salida del Sol" is a classical guitar composition from the 1900s that I learned in 2021.
                    It remains one of my most accomplished pieces. Set in an andante tempo and structured as A-B-A,
                    this composition showcases a precise blend of melody and harmony.
                    As part of my classical repertoire, "Salida del Sol" offers a serene musical journey,
                    evoking imagery of a slow sunrise over peaceful landscapes through its measured and calculated composition.
