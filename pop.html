                    This is a bery popular song, my guitar teacher often making fun of how many amateur fingerpicking guitarists learn it.
                    Which makes it kind of the wonderwall of fingerpicking. This popularity also because of its simplicity, only really needing to learn two hand
                    shapes and that hand shape moving in predictable patterns across the fret board. Despite it's simplicity, it sounds amazing and
                    I play it often. I am currently trying to learn to sing on top of it to improve my multitasking of singing and playing at the same time

                    This song is stupidly easy, only needing 4 chords, although I do like to switch out the Em and C in the first 2 playings of the verse chord progression 
                    with an Em7 and a Cadd9 respectively to make it sound better and to provide some challenge. The chords in the interlude arent shown, and so isn't the bridge, 
                    but those can be found quite simply online.
